<sub>*Computer Engineering undergrad student* at Universidade Federal da Paraíba</sub>

Hey, I'm João Pedro. (Since it's a complicated name to pronounce in english, you can call me JP)

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Though, I have spent most of my life where I currently live João Pessoa, Brazil.

I'm a Computer Engineering Undergrad student at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br), and a Machine Learning Researcher at [ArIA - Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory](https://aria.ci.ufpb.br), where I've been studying Artificial Intelligence for the past months.

I'm also the Co-founder and Vice president of TAIL (Technology and Artificial Intelligence League) at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br). We're a research group, made by students, focused on spread knowledge on our state. Our primary goal is to construct a strong community of Artificial Intelligence developers.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning random stuff, traveling, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and caffeine :)

**Background in:** C/C++, Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.

# Tests

The following tests were solved:

1. (:muscle:) [Document Cleanup]() (Computer Vision)
2. (:ok_hand:) [SMS Spam Detection]() (Natural Language Processing)


The resolutions were made available as Jupyter Notebook. There are two notebooks in each challenge directory:

- [DocumentCleanup]() 
- [DocumentCleanup-Local]()

- [SMSSpamDetection]()
- [SMSSpamDetection-Local]() 

The files without "Local" in the name are adapted for GitHub jupyter notebook visualization, without the need to download the code to view it.

I recommend to everyone who wants a better experience viewing the answer to download the repository and run the "Local" notebooks.

# Summary

As an extra help, use the following checklist to verify if everything is ok:

- [x] Downloaded all the test files using the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hAyIlI8NjvG8dkm8hmAe3URf2v9Tlfz-/view?usp=sharing).
- [x] Create a suitable solution using scripts, open-source libraries, own-code solutions, etc. **Consider we follow your instructions to run your code and look the outcome.**
- [x] Make sure that the output for the choosen tests are in accordance with the required output explained in the README.md file for each challenge.
- [x] **Choose at least two tests to be solved.** If the candidate is thrilled to solve them all it is ok too :smile:.
- [x] Make commentaries or auxiliary documentation files (e.g. README files) to assist the interpretation of your solutions. **Remember:** we love to read your comments and explanations! :heart_eyes:
- [x] Save the resulting code, scripts, documentatiion, etc on separated folders with complies with the same name as the input dataset (just to help us :+1:)
- [x] Prepare the commits on the separated branch using the naming standard: `first + last name`.
- [x] Submit the PR! (fingers crossed :blush:)
